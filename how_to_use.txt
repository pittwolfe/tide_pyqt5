 4. From Day First input, select "True" if your data timestamp parses dates with the day first. Otherwise, select "False" if your data doesn't begin with day first. As an example, if the time parses 10/09/2019 (October 9th 2019), select "False".

 5. Select your data separator.

 6. If you wish to plot the observation data, push "Plot Observation Data" which located on the right side of file location text box. Note that you have to insert timestamp and depth header first in order to plot your observation data.

10. Select the first and last date of tide prediction from two calendar boxes.

11. Insert time interval of tide prediction in hourly unit or in minutes.

12. Push "Analyse Tide" button if you wish to save the tide parameters. The report will be saved in the save location that you insert before with an addition of "report" and the tide method at the end of the file name.

13. Select the checkboxes in the middle of "Analyse Tide" and "Predict Tide" button as you desire. The default state would be checked on both checkboxes (save prediction and plot prediction). If you unselect both checkboxes, pushing "Predict Tide" button will lead to showing tide prediction table.

If you check on "Save Prediction" box, the tide prediction file will be saved in the save location that you insert before with an addition of the tide method at the end of the file name.
